# Mr.Jack
Strategic board game (BP project)
One of the players plays Mr Jack. He will be called Jack in these rules. He is the only one who knows which identity he has borrowed. His goal is to escape the investigator before dawn (at the end of the eighth turn) or to leave the district by taking advantage of the darkness.
The other player plays the police detective. He will be called «the detective» in these rules. His goal is to uncover which investigator Jack is impersonating and to catch him before dawn. But he can try to catch Jack only once in the game!
At each turn, four characters are used (two by the detective and two by Jack). Then there is a call for witnesses. Jack must now announce whether the character which he is impersonating is visible or not.
A. During the odd-numbered turns (1-3-5-7):
Draw the first four character cards from the pile and place them face up.
The detective chooses a character among the four and plays it (he moves the character token and/or uses the character's special ability). The character card is then turned over and placed face down.
Jack then chooses two characters from the three remaining ones. He plays them in the same way, and then places the cards face down
And finally, the detective plays the last face-up character.
B. During the even-numbered turns (2-4-6-8):
Turn the four unused character cards face up.
Jack now chooses a character and plays it, the detective then plays two characters, and finally Jack plays the last one.
